how to work with a coding problem
---

resist the urge to jump straight to code.

problem too easy?
- you're underestimating
- it's not the right company.

steps:
- read the description three times. produce an outline.
- test cases -- happy paths, fail paths, edge cases
- communicate and clarify.
- have a plan (an algorithm), and verify with that.
- abstraction
