// Build a program that randomly generates Teddy's age, and logs it to the console. Have the age be a random number between 20 and 200 (inclusive).


// Teddy is 69 years old!
console.log(`Teddy is ${Math.floor(20 + Math.random() * 181)} years old!`);
console.log(`Teddy is ${Math.round(20 + Math.random() * 180)} years old!`);
