// Write a function that colors a specific generation of the DOM tree. A generation is a set of elements that are on the same level of indentation. We'll be using a "styled" HTML for this exercise to better visualize the generations. You may use the .generation-color class to color the specific generation. You can assume that only non-negative integers will be provided as arguments. Following are some sample output to help you test your code:

generation - same level of indentation
.generation-color class
arguments - non-negative

start at document.body
initiate with an array
call it relevant elements: assign it
