Dr Commandlove: or How I Learnt
to Stop Worrying and Love the Terminal
---

Why I like the command line:
1. You feel closer to the tools running the computer.
2. Having a keyboard-only interface makes it faster to do things over time,
and you don't have to think about using the mouse.
`cdls`
3. It's more intentional as a workflow, and durable.
`lazygit`
4. You start taking ownership of the content, and how you interact with it.
`mpv play speed`
5. With a reduction of interface, it's just the content and you. This means
there are fewer distractions.
`micro, mpv, youtube-dl`
6. A standardised input means you can maintain the same font, which provides
consistency.
`wget`
7. It doesn't have to be cryptic. Liberal use of man pages, and double dash
flags means that it can be descriptive.
`curl --method GET --max-delay 30`
8. As soon as you find repetition in your workflow, you can make a shortcut
of it.
9. It allows you to use software that is usually free.
10. A healthy way of differentiating between work and play.
11. The web browser is too many things.

Keyboard only interface frees up your second hand, and allows your eye to
be more still. This encourages focus on the problem.

Critical mass of useful terminal applications, which make spending most of
your time there viable.
