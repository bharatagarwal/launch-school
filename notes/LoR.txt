remind them of your interactions with them
small statement of purpose

I am applying for a study abroad program. (Explain the program here.) Would you be able to write a letter for me? (Then give the due date.) Attached is my resume/CV and my transcripts. If possible, I would love the opportunity to come and meet with you sometime to discuss the program in more depth. Looking forward to your email.
