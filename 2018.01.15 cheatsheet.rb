ruby data types
	numbers
	strings
	booleans

input method:
	gets
	add chomp to remove newline

variable.capitalize! does so to itself

=begin

multiline comment	
	
=end

# single line comment

if elsif end
	conditionals have to have end in them

gets input still a string, not a boolean

string interpolation, "your name is #{name}" only works in double quotes, not single quotes

** exponential

.gsub! global substitution
